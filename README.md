Requirements:

Libraries: scapy, numpy, pandas
Access to network traffic (could be via a packet capture file or real-time monitoring using tools like tcpdump)

Basic Steps:

Capture Network Traffic: Use scapy or a similar tool to capture network traffic.
Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the traffic data.
Anomaly Detection: Implement an algorithm to detect anomalies in the traffic.
Alert Mechanism: Notify or log when an anomaly is detected.


Access the Web Dashboard:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You should see the network traffic dashboard. The bar chart will update every 5 seconds, showing the number of requests from different IP addresses.
