## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 🔒 Private Disclosure

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)
2. **Subject**: Use "Security Vulnerability Report - DDoS Detection System"
3. **Encryption**: Use our PGP key for sensitive information (available on request)

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and affected components
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, package versions
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or screenshots (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for remediation

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: 2-4 weeks (depending on severity)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is released and users have time to update

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers and will:

- Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Provide a detailed response about our investigation
- Keep you updated throughout the remediation process

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Network Security
- Run with minimal required privileges
- Use firewall rules to restrict access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies
- Regularly update dependencies

#### Application Security
- Change default secret keys in production
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper access controls
- Enable audit logging

#### Configuration Security
```bash
# Use environment variables for secrets
export SECRET_KEY="your-secure-random-key"
export DATABASE_URL="encrypted-connection-string"

# Restrict network access
export WEB_HOST="127.0.0.1"  # Local only
export ALLOWED_HOSTS="trusted-domain.com"

# Enable security features
export DEBUG="False"
export CORS_ORIGINS="https://trusted-domain.com"
```

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow secure coding practices

#### Dependency Security
```bash
# Regular security audits
pip audit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
bandit -r src/

# Keep dependencies updated
pip-review --auto
```

#### Development Environment
- Use virtual environments
- Never commit secrets to version control
- Use pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Regular dependency updates

## Known Security Considerations

### Network Monitoring
- **Privilege Requirements**: Raw packet capture requires elevated privileges
- **Data Sensitivity**: Network traffic may contain sensitive information
- **Performance Impact**: High-volume monitoring may affect system performance

### Web Interface
- **Authentication**: Currently no built-in authentication (add reverse proxy)
- **Rate Limiting**: Basic rate limiting implemented
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized

### Data Storage
- **Log Files**: May contain IP addresses and network metadata
- **Memory**: Traffic data stored in memory (cleared on restart)
- **Persistence**: No persistent storage of sensitive data by default

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- IP address format validation
- Port number range checking
- String sanitization and length limits
- Configuration value validation

### Rate Limiting
- API endpoint protection
- Configurable request limits
- IP-based throttling
- Automatic blocking for abuse

### Logging Security
- Structured logging with levels
- Log rotation and size limits
- No sensitive data in logs
- Configurable log retention

### Network Security
- CORS protection
- Secure headers
- Input sanitization
- Error message sanitization

## Compliance

This software is designed to help with:

- **Network Security Monitoring**
- **Incident Response**
- **Compliance Reporting**
- **Audit Trail Generation**

However, users are responsible for:
- Compliance with local laws and regulations
- Data privacy and protection requirements
- Network monitoring policies
- Incident response procedures
